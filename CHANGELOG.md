# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-27

### Editor
- **Nested elements** (Unity-style): drop an element onto another in the Layers tree to put it
  inside. Children always draw in front of their parent and move, hide, lock, copy and delete with
  it. Multi-selections can be dragged into a parent in one step.
- **Layer "…" menu** with *Export layer…*: export only one layer (optionally cropped to its
  content) to explain a single form to an LLM.
- **WIREFRAGMA schema** export tab: LLM-ready instructions (with an example and a JSON Schema) so a
  chat model can *generate* a project; Import accepts the answer as-is (`ui-project` / `json`
  fence or JSON in prose).
- Resizable Projects / Add / Layers panels; Projects and Layers collapse to identical rails.
- UI in **8 languages** (EN, RU, DE, FR, ES, SR, JA, ZH) and a **dark / system theme**. The
  Markdown export stays English.

### Accounts (optional backend)
- Sign-up with captcha, email confirmation and privacy-policy consent; sign-in, password reset,
  profile settings (name, language, theme, password), account deletion — or continue without an
  account.
- Projects panel: projects with wireframes, instant switching with per-wireframe undo history,
  autosave to MySQL with conflict detection, import into a chosen project.
- Plain PHP + MySQL (`server/`), deployable on ordinary shared hosting; see
  `docs/deployment.md` and `docs/accounts.md`.

### Fixes (from a code audit)
- Notes containing ``` code fences no longer break re-import; unreadable saved data is never
  overwritten; a second touch can no longer corrupt undo history; Cmd+Z mid-drag is ignored;
  canvas size / font size can be typed; the Grid button repaints; dialogs close on Escape and block
  editor shortcuts; Layers rows are keyboard-accessible; huge canvases no longer blank out.
